# JavaScript Tutorial [W3Schools](https:/www.w3schools.com/js/)

This is a reformatting of this great tutorial which spans through several
pages. I tried to put it in MarkDown format and later to translate it to
brazilian portuguese. In this branch you will find the english version.
I recommend to novices to follow original pages from W3Schools.
I changed some parts to include one explanation or to exclude text when it is
refering to *other* pages or chapters that are now in the same page.
